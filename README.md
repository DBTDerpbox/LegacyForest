# Forest

Forest is a custom map for the Legacy Edition Battle Remake for Java Edition. This is the public repository where you can help with the development of the map.
The map at the moment can be played on the experimental server until ModTools are stable enough to be released in the main server.

For information on how to actually use this repository, please see the [LEB-ModTools documentation](https://github.com/DBTDerpbox/LEB-ModTools/wiki)
